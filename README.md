A simple extension of QTabWidget that allows various things to be added to any spare space next to the tabs.

This allows one of three things

1. A Login button
2. A Digital Clock
3. A Message Box.

Each of these has several options.

The clock can show or hide seconds.

The Login button has two forms, a standard form with username/password
and a simpler form that only allows a password to be set.

The message box allows the background/foreground colours to be changed,
either permanently or temporarily. Marquee'ing of long text messages are
also allowed.

All three can be drawn with or without frames.

This is available under the GPL version 3.0 so anything that is available
under this license is fine.
 Of course if your computer blows up or your country sinks into the sea you
 are on your own.
